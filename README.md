CEVidium - Video Conversion and On-Calculator Playback Project
==============================================================
Warning:
* **This only works on the TI-84+ CE.**
* This will not work on the TI-84+ CSE.
* This will not work on any TI-84+ (SE)

Motivation
----------
I wanted to see Bad Apple play on my TI-84 CE.
Then I wanted to see more cool stuff.

Project Dependencies
--------------------
* Python 2.7.x
* FFmpeg (you may need to Google how to install this; they don't make it easy)
* ffmpy (Python library used to link to FFmpeg; install via pip/pip2)
* pillow (Python Imaging Library fork; install via pip/pip2)
* CE programming toolchain (described in the video player section)


Converting the Video
--------------------
1. Copy your .MP4 or other video file to the CEVENCODER folder.
2. Rename that video to a name that contains 8 or less characters.
3. Open a command prompt in the CEVENCODER folder.
4. Type: 
   * `BUILD2.BAT -h`
5. Read the options, then retype the above line without the '-h' flag and with
   the flags that you want. For example, if your input video is MYVID.mp4 and you
   wanted to use the 96-by-X 4 level grayscale encoding with dithering:
   * `BUILD2.BAT -i MYVID.mp4 -e M1G4 -d`
6. If everything worked, copy the contents of CEVENCODER/bin to your calculator.

Building and Sending the Video Player
-------------------------------------
1. If you have not installed the CE programming toolchain, download and install
   from: https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases
2. Open a command prompt in the CEVPLAY folder and type the following in order:
   * `make gfx`
   * `make`
3. If everything worked, copy CEVPLAY/bin/CEVIDIUM.8xp to your calculator.

Building and Sending the Decoders
---------------------------------
1. Double-click CEVDECODER/build.bat to run it.
2. If everything worked, copy the contents of CEVDECODER/bin to your calculator.

Copyrights and Licenses
-----------------------
* The ZX7 (de)compression code and executable was done by Einar Saukas.
  See CEVENCODER/tools/ZX7_LICENSE for details.
* SPASM-ng (e)z80 assembler was done by a bunch of people.
  See CEVDECODER/tools/SPASM_LICENSE for details.
* The rest of Project CEVidium was done by me.
  See LICENSE for details.
  
Acknowledgements
----------------
* Merged fix for counting logic, by github user ctrefethen
* Those fixes for the original version of the encoder, by commandblockguy, whose
  pull requests I mismanaged because I didn't know what I was doing. (sorry!)
  
Controlling the Video Player
----------------------------

Controls on video selection:

| Keys     |  Function         |

|[Mode]    | Quit CEVidium     |
|[2nd]     | Start video       |
|arrow keys| Show next video   |

Controls during playback:

| Keys     |  Function                         |
|---------:|:----------------------------------|
|[Mode]    | Retrun to video selection         |
|[2nd]     | (Un)pause the video               |
|[Left]    | Rewind video by one segment       |
|[Right]   | Fast forward video by one segment |


 
Version History
---------------
* 0.00 - Initial commit
* 0.01 - Updated the documentation to make what's available actually useable
* 0.02 - Updated docs again, figuring out merge stuff to include others' improvements.

Known Issues
------------
* Deprecated the original encoder toolkit without prior notice but still have
  references for it for debugging purposes. You should be using BUILD2.bat
* If you choose to modify the build to use the old codecs, encoder 4 (DECODR03)
  is known to crash.
